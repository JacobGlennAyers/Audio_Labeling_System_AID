## Usage

*Note: Please see [getting started](docs/getting-started.md) guide for configurations and concrete usage.*

Please install the following dependencies to run `audino` on your system:

1. [git](https://git-scm.com/) *[tested on v2.23.0]*
2. [docker](https://www.docker.com/) *[tested on v19.03.8, build afacb8b]*
3. [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) *[tested on v1.25.5, build 8a1c60f6]*

### Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/midas-research/audino.git
$ cd audino
```

**Note for Windows users**: Please configure git to handle line endings correctly as services might throw an error and not come up. You can do this by cloning the project this way:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/midas-research/audino.git --config core.autocrlf=input
```

### For Production

You can either run the project on [default configuration](./docker-compose.prod.yml) or modify them to your need.
**Note**: Before proceeding further, you might need to give docker `sudo` access or run the commands listed below as `sudo`.

**To build the services, run:**

```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
```

**To bring up the services, run:**

```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

Then, in browser, go to [http://0.0.0.0/](http://0.0.0.0/) to view the application.

**To bring down the services, run:**

```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
```

### For Development

Similar to `production` setup, you need to use development [configuration](./docker-compose.dev.yml) for working on the project, fixing bugs and making contributions.
**Note**: Before proceeding further, you might need to give docker `sudo` access or run the commands listed below as `sudo`.

**To build the services, run:**

```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
```

**To bring up the services, run:**

```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Then, in browser, go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view the application.

**To bring down the services, run:**

```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```
